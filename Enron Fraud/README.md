# Enron Fraud Detecting

Enron Corporation was a huge company in electricity, natural gas etc. Its shares were worth $90.75 in 2001. Out of the blue, it declared bankruptcy on December 2, 2001. Many investors even Wall Street were astounded. After investigation, there were some executives fooled the regulators with fake holdings for so long.

In this project, we're going to extract informations from salary, holdings, number of messages...etc and construct the machine learning model to find these cover-up.
